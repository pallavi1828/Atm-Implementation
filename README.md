ATM Simulation Project
This project is a fully interactive ATM simulator built with Java (backend logic) and a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript (frontend) interface. It simulates real-world ATM functionalities including:

PIN verification with retry limits and cooldown timers

OTP-based PIN change with time-restricted retry logic

Options for Balance Inquiry, Deposit, Withdrawal, Account Details, and PIN Reset

Smooth user interaction via keyboard (Enter key) and automatic field resets

Stylized, accessible, and mobile-friendly interface

The system mimics real banking scenarios to enhance user experience and security, making it ideal for demonstrating frontend-backend integration and user flow design.
